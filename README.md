HeaderControlViewPagerExample
===

This android project shows you how to manage show/hide toolbar while content scroll in an activity with ViewPager that includes Fragments with ListView, ScrollView, and WebView.

In this example, you don't need to add extra top padding/margin/header to ListView/ScrollView/WebView.
